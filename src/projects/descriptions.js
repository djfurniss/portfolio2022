    grouPlay: "This app is my favorite thing that I'm working on currently! It's designed to be a place where a group of friends can control their music together. When with friends, there's usually a descussion or argument about who is going to be responsible for playing music. Having a shared playlist and music player in one eliminates that problem.",

This project focused heavilly on my understanding of React including hooks like useState and useEffect.",

There are two buttons, clear and backspace to allow for editing on the calculator's screen.",
