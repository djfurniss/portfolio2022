I am 22 years young in the process of transitioning careers from ASL interpreter to software engineer and it has been the best decision I've made in a long time! Currently, I'm enrolled in Thinkful's immersion boot camp. Tech has always had a special place in my heart and brain but it wasn't the career choice I initially followed, unfortunately. But now I'm here and ready to take it head-on! I'm always up for a challenge to pick at my brain and make me think. I am super excited to build and connect with colleagues and mentors and develop new skills to put to the test!</p>
